CPU tests are flaky as if your just looking at one or two jiffys its
impossible to guage real usage.  Need to implement laggy detection (aka
 needs to fail at least 3 times in a row before detection)
  -- Another option is to just keep the CPU occupied with other things
  -- so we're measuring CPU of the child process better (aka there is 
  -- competition for jiffys so if the child is getting them it means 
  -- something, as opposed to now where you can be at '100% cpu' and
  -- only use 1 or 2 jiffys out of 1 or 2 jiffys.  Maybe a background
  -- spin thread?

Don't scan the proc table twice on each update() call

Implement restarting and alerting limits
Implement HTTP Watcher
Implement 'flexible' limits, aka how long a process can be in
   violation before its killed
Add Logging
