CPU Usage should be calculated taking into account IDLE jiffies?
Keep a list of vioated constraints and expose via HTTP
Seperate logs per task invokation
Run as a different user
Fixed expiration or task timeout
Expose logs via http, maybe /logs?
Think about where logs should go by default, /tmp?
Expose task-sitter logs, too!
Set CPU Core Affinity
STDOUT Redirection / Logging
Ensure arguements are the proper format inside the argument parsing
   function, not in random places throughout the codebase (like the
   Process harness constructor)
Have constraints output a % instead of a bool so we can do warnings at
thresholds.
Don't use recursion in ensure_alive -- can hit a maximum!
Test infinite restarting somehow
Implement HTTP Watcher
Implement Alerting in HTTP Interface
Implement 'flexible' limits, aka how long a process can be in
   violation before its killed
Add Logging
